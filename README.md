# BYOBToDotpy

The idea behind this project is to produce (or stimulate someone else) a block based IDE for Python.

Young coders originally learn Scratch and then need to transistion to Python (as current next progression teaching language).

This means having to learn a new language and syntax and also learn to type in particular style.

This project is designed to used as a transistion tool so that Scratchers can start off by using a block-based IDE and seeing the text based code being produced for them.

It currently will handle some common Python constructs and I'd welcome any feedback on using it

To use
Run BYOBtoDotPy.py - it will sit and listen for msgs from BYOB

Open up BYOB and load some of the sample .ypr projects to see how things work - press Green Flag to get the project to convert from blocks to .py (dotpy.py)
